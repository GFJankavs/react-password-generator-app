### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tooling

### Continued development

I will try and create more projects with different JS frameworks to grasp better understanding in how each JS framework/library differ from one another.
